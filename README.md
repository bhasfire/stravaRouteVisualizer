# 3D Route Runner

Visualize your outdoor activities in 3D using Photorealistic 3D Tiles and CesiumJS. This tool allows you to upload a GPX file and see your route brought to life in a three-dimensional environment.

## Getting Started

To use the 3D Route Runner, you will need a GPX file of your activity. You can obtain this file from services like Strava, Garmin Connect, etc. Once you have your GPX file, you can upload it to the visualizer and see your route in 3D.

### Try It Yourself

Check out the live version of the 3D Route Runner [HERE](https://bhasfire.github.io/stravaRouteVisualizer/).

### Using a Demo File

If you don't have a GPX file, you can use one of the demo files provided. Simply download one of the files below and upload it to the visualizer:

- [Demo File 1 - 18mi Long Run in Austin](https://github.com/bhasfire/stravaRouteVisualizer/blob/master/data/18mi_long_run.gpx)
